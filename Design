Quick way to remove text by Photoshop
https://www.quora.com/Can-I-remove-text-from-an-image-in-Phtoshop


Process of Scanlation:
Start -> Get the Raw -> Typesetting to white out orginial text -> Translate -> Add translated text -> End

Design ideas:
1. Page management for chapter or book during translation: I don't see any tool or plugin to help manage between pages, especially when those pages form a comic chapter or book. Created as a project, and save as a file contain all those translation info (Text, position, and etc.)
2. Translation typing area for section or bubble: Easy to type and edit later
3. Automatic adjustment for section or bubble: Japanese word in comic usually type at vertical. Chinese can go vertical as same, but English need to go horizontal. Either way, need to break line
4. Automatic detect text area
