Tranditional Scanlation Process:
-> Get the Raw from Raw provider
-> Cleaner begin to edit the scanned pages to improve picture quality, also generally remove the original text
-> Often simultaneously with the cleaners, translator translating all dialogue, generally compiled into a text file
-> Typesetter collects the translated script
-> Back to Translator or someone to double-check (if any)

Drawbacks that I want ot improve from Tranditional:
1. When Typesetter get translated text, need to know the matching area to insert
2.


Process of propose usage of project:
-> Open the software 
-> Create a project 
-> Import image 
-> Define Translating area on image and create corresponding typing area
-> Enter translation
-> Micro change on to fit translation into image
-> Export new image with translation
-> Repeat above process from "Import image" until whole chapter or book's images finish
-> Save project with translation info (keep images in project file or without images to keep the size of project file low) 

Design ideas:
1. Page management for chapter or book during translation process between different roles: I don't see any tool or plugin to help manage the process between different roles. Created as a project, and save as a file contain all those translation info (Text, position, and etc.)
2. Translation typing area for section or bubble: Easy to type and edit later
3. Automatic adjustment for section or bubble: Japanese word in comic usually type at vertical. Chinese can go vertical as same, but English need to go horizontal. Either way, need to break line
4. Automatic detect text area
5. Automatic translation
6. Online feature

Drawbacks:
1. Since project don't save image, won't know if the import image correc or not
2. Same image with different size (or different scan resource), will not fit in to translation info
