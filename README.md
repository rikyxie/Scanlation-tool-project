# Project name
Scanlation tool project (No name yet)

# Description
I am following many comic books but many of them stop updated because of many different reasons, such as lack of raws, or lack of man power. Base on the Scanlation Process from Fanlore wiki [https://fanlore.org/wiki/Scanlation_Process], and for my experience, even though scanlation group is always looking for people for all the positions, Editor (typesetting and cleaning is always grouped together as editing) is the most needed position.
